      I love to tweak and hack technology in creative ways.
      <br>
      We don't need to break things to make new things, and we don't need to reinvent the wheel, either. So many amazing things exist to build on.<br>
      Let's focus on bending the rules without breaking the rules.</p>

    <p draggable="false">I've always loved creating things. As a child, I started first with Basic, Hypercard, C, Pascal and VB. As I got older, I moved to PHP, then Python, and created some amazing things like <a href="https://etsy.com/" draggable="false">Etsy</a>&nbsp;and Startr. These days I focus on&nbsp;<a href="https://robotinacan.com/" draggable="false">Robots </a>&nbsp;and other projects.</p>

    <p draggable="false">I love to create things that are useful and beautiful. Things that inspire others to create are the most powerful and rewarding to build.<br>I love to create things that are fun and silly. Things that are weird and wonderful I love the most.<br>While I love creating beautiful things, I enjoy keeping them exposed and raw. Brutally functional things often feel best to me.</p>

    <p draggable="false">To these ends, this project is inspired by my reflecting on life and reading Gödel, Escher, Bach, and, most importantly, talking with friends and family. The code was inspired by&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/secretGeek/" draggable="false">secretGeek</a>  and <a href="https://sr.ht/~sforman" draggable="false">my close friend Simon Forman</a>.
    </p>

    <p draggable="false">The computer science world of code is filled with examples of amazing people stretching the rules and blowing past expectations. People use technology in new and fabulous ways every day.</p>

    <p draggable="false">I love the creativity that sparks further change. Quines are programs
      which output their source code. Used properly, they can spark all kinds of possibilities. If code is life, life is a Quine! As we build new things...they build more!</p>

    <p draggable="false">Exposing how things work lets us&nbsp;<strong draggable="false">make the internal external </strong>, and reveal the secrets of what we build, in somehow.... brutally beautiful -<em draggable="false">brutaful</em> ways.
    </p>

    <p draggable="false">&nbsp;A similar approach when building with code is the idea of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects" draggable="false">naked objects</a>. <br>When working with naked objects:
    </p>

    <blockquote draggable="false">
     Objects represent concepts
     in their purest form, 
     without additional 
     layers or abstractions.

     The goal of naked objects
     is simplicity and
     transparency.

      can do this on any page. 
    </p>
    <p draggable="false">The "naked objects" concept was introduced by a software developer named Martin Fowler. He proposed that instead of hiding the true nature of objects behind layers of abstractions and interfaces, we should instead reveal the objects in their "naked" form.</p>
    <p draggable="false">
      Putting all this together, I decided to make this: a truly naked, brutalist html
      page; a page itself a quine; a page that is a<em draggable="false">brutaful quine.</em>
    </p>
    <p draggable="false">This means exposing the objects in their purest, fundamental form without unnecessary embellishments or distractions. Basically, it's a way of thinking about software design that prioritizes simplicity and transparency over layers of indirection.</p>

    <a id="how_it_works" draggable="false"></a>
    <h2 draggable="false">How it works.</h2>

    <p draggable="false">
      Did you know that the rules of html and css allow us to make
      <strong draggable="false">every</strong> element visible, even elements like 'title' or
      'style' or 'script', that are normally hidden from view? <br>Those are just
      elements like any other.<br>You can expose them <strong draggable="false">all</strong> like so:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      * {
        display: block;
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">
      With that snippet of code (which <strong draggable="false">is not</strong> a snippet of
      code, but an <strong draggable="false">actual</strong> style block!), you can now see
      every element of this page, including that style block, the HTML and title
      tags, etc.
    </p>

    <aside draggable="false">
      You might have noticed that we have a little menu at the top of the page. There is a link to "Edit" the page in that menu. If you click that link, you can edit the page, even the style block above! Don't worry
      if you mess up; you can always refresh the page to get back to the version you last opened.<br>If you want to keep your changes, use the "Save" link and save things to work locally on your computer, tablet, or even phone. (Tell me if you run into any problems).</aside>

    <p draggable="false">
      Our little style element does have one downside: every element on the page is now a "block"
      element, even some which should be "inline", such as "code" and "anchor"
      elements. We can correct this like so:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      a,
      code,
      em,
      i,
      strong {
        display: inline;
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">
      To make it feel more like you are viewing the source, I've also applied
      <code draggable="false">monospace fonts</code>&nbsp;and a generally simple and consistent style
      to all elements, using a "*" selector, like so:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      * {
        font-family: Monospace;
        margin: 1.5em 0;
        padding: 0;
        text-decoration: none;
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">So far, I've put style declarations all on one line because ordinary HTML refuses to treat line breaks as "br" tags. But there is a way
      to make line breaks display as line breaks, and that is with this
      piece of styling:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      script,
      style {
        white-space: pre;
      }

      /* TODO move these */
      blockquote {
        white-space: pre-wrap;
      }

      p {
        word-break: break-word;
      }
    </style>

    <h2 draggable="false">Make the internal external</h2>

    <p draggable="false">The next step in making an HTML Quine is to make the internal external. We can start by 
      ensuring that the tags themselves, such as paragraph tags, are 
      exposed in their stark, natural, brutal beauty:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      /* This is a style comment. Below are special 
         before and after styling for our <p></p>, otherwise 
         known as paragraph elements. */
      p::before {
        content: '<p>';
      }
      p::after {
        content: '</p>';
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">Adding these special pseudo-elements works for "&lt;p&gt;" elements, but we need to have custom styling for
      <strong draggable="false">every</strong> element. Pseudo-elements are special keywords that allow us to style specific parts of selected elements.</p>
    <p draggable="false">We'll need something to add a before and after&nbsp;pseudo-element to each element.If there was a way to output the "name" of
      a tag in HTML, then we could reduce all of the necessary style rules above
      to something like&nbsp;</p>

    <blockquote draggable="false">
      *::before {'&lt;'name()'&gt;'}
    </blockquote>

    <p draggable="false">And...</p>

    <blockquote draggable="false">
      *::after { '&lt;'name()'&gt;' }
    </blockquote>

    <p draggable="false">But alas there is no "name()" function (yet!). So we are forced to
      generate a chunk of style information like this 👇</p>

    <details draggable="false">
      <summary draggable="false">
        <p draggable="false">It's a lot of repetitive code, so I wrapped it in a details and summary set. Feel free to click read all the lines of repetitive yet essential style code.&nbsp;</p>

    <p draggable="false">Let's also make it so that whenever our cursor is over a summary tag, it is a pointer, and we'll also indent things by 4 characters (4 chars).

      summary {
        cursor: pointer;
        margin: 1ch 4ch;
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">Some elements are a little trickier because they have attributes. Attributes are special variables or settings that HTML elements can have. Consider, for example, the &lt;a&gt; or ⚓️ (anchor), which often has a <code draggable="false">href</code> attribute. We
      <em draggable="false">need</em> that attribute, including its value, to be visible. This is
      done like so:
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      a[href]::before {
        content: "<a href='" attr(href) "'>";
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">
      The <code draggable="false">attr()</code> function, see
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/attr" draggable="false">mozilla docs</a>
      is a nifty trick, "supported" since CSS 2.
    </p>

    <p draggable="false">A surprisingly troublesome set of tags are any that don't close. Two examples of these non-closing tags are &lt;br&gt; and &lt;img&gt;. While we can make our &lt;br&gt;s visible(on most browsers) by adding empty content, this isn't the case with images now.</p>
    <style draggable="false">
      /* This doesn't work on Safari */
      br {
        content: "";
        margin: 0;
      }

      br::after {
        content: "<br>";
        margin-top: -1em;

    <p draggable="false">&nbsp;Another special element is 
      "style" itself, which must include an escape character to avoid 
      being taken literally. Here is the styling code and a little tweak 
      to keep our closing style tags from being indented.</p>

    <style draggable="false">
      style::before {
        content: '<style>';
      }
      style::after {

      /* While we are at it, let's have a little 
         fun and style our style elements, giving
         them a background and a font */
      style {
        background: hsl(270, 63.5%, 50%, 20%);
        font-family: Geneva_9;
        font-size: 1.4em;
        overflow: auto;
      }
    </style>

    <aside draggable="false">I think the need for escaping the closing tag (e.g. "\/style" instead of "/style") of our style element may be a parser 
      bug. Browser developers might not have predicted that we would engage in the fun we're exploring here.
    </aside>

    <p draggable="false">Along with this, we will expose any script 
      tags and ensure their
      content is pre-formated.
    </p>

    <style draggable="false">
      script::before {
        content: '<script>';
      }
      script::after {

        margin-left: -3.1ch;
      }

      /* Let's theme our script elements */
      script {
        background: hsl(210, 63.5%, 50%, 20%);
        font-family: Geneva_9;
        font-size: 1.4em;
        overflow: auto;
      }
    </style>

    <p draggable="false">If we don't do a little more tweaking to our document's head element, our style and script tags are  
      exposed but look messy. Their closing tag will be indented, unlike in our body. So we need to 
      add a little more style to the head element to fix this.</p>

    <style draggable="false">
      head script::after,

      }

      /*  Oh, and we need links for external resources */

      link[href]::before {

      You might be wondering about that menu at the top of our
      page.&nbsp;</p>
    <p draggable="false">Here's how it works. First, we use the "position: sticky" style to allow it to stick to the top of our page once we scroll to it. With it stuck to the top of our viewport, it stays there unless we scroll above where we loaded it (just after we opened our body element).&nbsp;</p>
    <p draggable="false">As we want things to stay tidy in our menu, we'll hide the hrefs from our anchors.</p>

    <style draggable="false">

      blockquote::after {
