# Startr Style–less

## Why start with Startr Style – Simplifying CSS Frameworks is hard

- The pursuit of simplifying styling in CSS frameworks often leads to bulky, overcomplicated code.
- The web is built upon basic HTML elements and shouldn't require packaging large amounts of dependencies.
- Adding wrappers and CSS classes increases complexity, memory usage, and slows down style calculations.
- Embrace the elegance of simplicity by creating CSS frameworks that prioritize the basics.
- Allow for customization without the need for hyper-overriding styles.
- A framework that hinders creativity and innovation is not useful.
